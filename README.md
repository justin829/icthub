# ICT Hub Nyamira — Website

This is a small static website for ICT Hub Nyamira that advertises short courses for youth and provides a course application form for the next cohorts.

How to use locally:

- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with).
- The application form uses client-side validation and stores submissions in `localStorage` as a placeholder. There is no backend in this simple starter site.

Next steps / deployment:

- Add a backend to collect applications (e.g., a small Node/Express or serverless function) and remove localStorage usage.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for a live site.
